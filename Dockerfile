# FIXME: These are not currently working on Alpine as-is but require some

# Define the default ENTRYPOINT to start synchronizations and development mode
#
# By default this entrypoint will start in development mode as stated above,
# although it *is* possible to start it in production mode.
#
# This entrypoint is *only* used if this image is not used as a base image for
# a production build. It can be used to build a production app when starting
# without defining a specific Dockerfile deriving from this image.
#
# It is however recommended that you do a complete prebuild and prepare of the
# production Volt application in your derived Dockerfile and separate image
# that is then deployed to your production server. Because any building
# errors/problems would not show up until you actually do the build. Rather
# handle those on the build server than on the production server.
#
# This option is provided to make it easier/quicker/faster to move forward to
# a production state for non-critical applications that you may want to deploy
# by simply doing a 'git pull' and then restart the container. YMMV!

# ============================================================================
#
# ONBUILD downstream build process
#
# Add ONBUILD steps to automatically build a production Volt application by
# simply depending on this image.
#
# To create a production Volt image you just need to create a Dockerfile in
# your root Volt app folder like this:
#
# echo >Dockerfile "FROM programlabbet/mini-volt"
#
# This will enable you to build a precompiled Volt application Docker image
# with a 'docker build .' command.
#
# When run it should as default fire up your application in a container on
# port 80. It does not contain a mongo database installation or anything else
# so you need to make sure that the Volt container has access to the database
# instance of your choice.
#
# If you need a simple mongo-db database setup for development purposes you
# can use the Docker image programlabbet/mongodb-volt. But *PLEASE* beware!
# There is absolutely NO SECURITY enabled and its only purpose is to provide
# a quick-and-dirty way to get a development environment up and running for
# your Volt application.

# Add the application SOURCE code
ONBUILD COPY . /app

# Remove unecessary files and folders (like .git and caches)
ONBUILD WORKDIR /app
ONBUILD RUN rm -rf .git .gitignore Dockerfile docker-compose.yml tmp compiled

# Map the src folder to the app folder
ONBUILD RUN sh -c '/scripts/build-production-app.sh'

# Add production entrypoint
ONBUILD ENTRYPOINT sh -c '/scripts/start-prod.sh'
